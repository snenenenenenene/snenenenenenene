# Hi there! 👋

How are you doing? =)

👉 Currently, I'm studying Computer Science @ [AP](https://www.ap.be/).

👉 I'm studying React ⚛️, React Native 📱 & Machine Learning 🤖.

## 🌱 On knowledge

I try to learn as much as possible from open-source projects, initiatives, and any other source of knowledge. 

Life is very complex, but we might as well learn as much as we can, right?

## 🗿 On projects & personal values

I believe technology can change people's lives, and open source projects are at the core of that. 

Thus, I am focused on creating & shipping projects that help on real-world issues, making the difference.
